There, the dashing prince falls in love with a white British clerk, Ruth Williams, and they plan to marry. While they suspect that his uncle, the Regent, would disapprove, nothing prepares them for the diplomatic firestorm and domestic political tumult their defiant love would spark. Now facing a citizenry leery of a white Briton as their Queen, the international opposition is even more unyielding from the British holding their land as a protectorate and fearful of South Africa's racist backlash to this affront to their apartheid domination. Against all odds, King Khama and Ruth must struggle to maintain their love and help their people in a land that would become the Republic of Botswana.","languages":"Tswana, English","country":"Czech Republic, UK, USA, France","awards":"1 win & 4 nominations.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUyNzE1MTAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU1Mzk5OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"metascore":"65","rating":"6.8","votes":"10,741","imdbid":"tt3387266","type":"movie","dvd":"06 Jun 2017","boxoffice":"&pound;3,901,302","production":"Harbinger Pictures","website":"http://www.aunitedkingdomfilm.com/","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3387266"}},{"fileName":"Bagp0Vii.P1k.2015.D.WEB-DL.1080p.mkv","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/Bagp0Vii.P1k.2015.D.WEB-DL.1080p.mkv","searchableName":"Bagp0Vii P1k 2015","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-09-01T18:02:29.000Z","modifiedTime":"2015-12-11T23:56:21.000Z","fileSizeMB":4607.859628677368},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4576870","imdbId":"tt4576870","imdbData":{"title":"Asspirations","_year_data":"2015","year":2015,"rated":"N/A","released":"2015-02-19T22:00:00.000Z","runtime":"180 min","genres":"Adult","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Bridgette B., Nikki Benz, Brooklyn Chase, Syren De Mer","plot":"N/A","languages":"English","country":"Canada","awards":"N/A","poster":"N/A","ratings":[],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"N/A","votes":"N/A","imdbid":"tt4576870","type":"movie","dvd":"N/A","boxoffice":"N/A","production":"N/A","website":"N/A","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4576870"}},{"fileName":"Chicken.People.2016.720p.WEB-DL.600MB.Ganool.ph.mkv","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/Chicken.People.2016.720p.WEB-DL.600MB.Ganool.ph.mkv","searchableName":"Chicken People 2016","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-09-01T14:16:09.000Z","modifiedTime":"2018-04-07T19:36:02.000Z","fileSizeMB":599.5708751678467},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4819510","imdbId":"tt4819510","imdbData":{"title":"Chicken People","_year_data":"2016","year":2016,"rated":"N/A","released":"2016-09-22T21:00:00.000Z","runtime":"83 min","genres":"Documentary, Comedy, Family","director":"Nicole Lucas Haimes","writer":"N/A","actors":"N/A","plot":"Chicken People is a funny and uplifting look at the world of show chickens and the people who love them.

Oliver is naturally a sullen man due to his growing up relationships with his parents (his mother who had a unique view on life) and watching his parents' cordial but somewhat distant relationship with each other, but is more so now because of his personal family losses. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress, hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death, and Hal's new outlook on life during that time, will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a joie de vivre that did not exist before, which included an open relationship with a much younger man named Andy. Oliver's relationship with Anna has other obstacles, including Anna's own vagabond lifestyle and Oliver needing to take care of who was originally Hal's very needy Jack Russell terrier, Arthur.","languages":"English, French","country":"USA","awards":"Won 1 Oscar.

David spends the rest of his time in companionable silence alongside his chatterbox friend Lenny (Aubrey Plaza), a fellow patient whose life-long drug and alcohol addiction has done nothing to quell her boundless optimism that her luck is about to change. The pleasant numbness of David's routine is completely upended with the arrival of a beautiful and troubled new patient named Syd (Rachel Keller).

To the chagrin of his superiors, Dan bucks the outlined curriculum of historical facts in favor of the philosophy of historical events, generally discussing the concept of dialectics. As such, he captures the imagination of his students, at least in the classroom. Outside of the classroom, Dan's life is in shambles. He has a distant but cordial relationship with his family. He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen year old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.","languages":"English","country":"USA, Australia, Spain","awards":"1 win & 5 nominations.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NzUwODExM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM0MzE4NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"42%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"47/100"}],"metascore":"47","rating":"6.9","votes":"102,970","imdbid":"tt1390411","type":"movie","dvd":"08 Mar 2016","boxoffice":"$19,043,843","production":"Warner Bros.

But that changes when a family-owned multinational conglomerate Mirando Corporation takes Okja for themselves and transports her to New York, where image obsessed and self-promoting CEO Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) has big plans for Mija's dearest friend. With no particular plan but single-minded in intent, Mija sets out on a rescue mission, but her already daunting journey quickly becomes more complicated when she crosses paths with disparate groups of capitalists, demonstrators and consumers, each battling to control the fate of Okja...while all Mija wants to do is bring her friend home. Deftly blending genres, humor, poignancy and drama, Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, The Host) begins with the gentlest of premises-the bond between man and animal-and ultimately creates a distinct and layered vision of the world that addresses the animal inside us all. Okja is a Plan B Entertainment, Lewis Pictures and Kate Street Picture Company production in association with Netflix.","languages":"English, Korean, Spanish","country":"South Korea, USA","awards":"6 wins & 10 nominations.","poster":"https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMTcxNDgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTczNTIzMjI@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"86%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"metascore":"75","rating":"7.4","votes":"59,150","imdbid":"tt3967856","type":"movie","dvd":"28 Jun 2017","boxoffice":"N/A","production":"Netflix","website":"http://netflix.com/okja","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3967856"}},{"fileName":"RBG.2018.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AM].mp4","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/RBG (2018) [BluRay] [1080p] [YTS.AM]/RBG.2018.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AM].mp4","searchableName":"RBG 2018","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-09-10T09:02:17.000Z","modifiedTime":"2018-09-10T09:02:17.000Z","fileSizeMB":1600.5151691436768},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7689964","imdbId":"tt7689964","imdbData":{"title":"RBG","_year_data":"2018","year":2018,"rated":"PG","released":"2018-09-13T21:00:00.000Z","runtime":"98 min","genres":"Documentary, Biography","director":"Julie Cohen, Betsy West","writer":"N/A","actors":"Bill Clinton, Sharron Frontiero, Jane C.

Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story - and survive this homecoming.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDk2NzY1MGQtYTA2MS00ZDcxLWJiMzYtNWRmMGU3ZjQ0YTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.3/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.3","votes":"8,552","imdbid":"tt2649356","type":"series","totalseasons":1,"response":"True","series":true,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2649356","_episodes":[],"start_year":2018,"end_year":null,"opts":{"apiKey":"4fbdbb36","timeout":15000}}},{"fileName":"Skyscraper.2018.1080p.WEBRip.x264-[YTS.AM].mp4","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/Skyscraper (2018) [WEBRip] [1080p] [YTS.AM]/Skyscraper.2018.1080p.WEBRip.x264-[YTS.AM].mp4","searchableName":"Skyscraper 2018","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-09-10T09:28:55.000Z","modifiedTime":"2018-09-10T08:27:00.000Z","fileSizeMB":1672.2699880599976},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5758778","imdbId":"tt5758778","imdbData":{"title":"Skyscraper","_year_data":"2018","year":2018,"rated":"PG-13","released":"2018-07-12T21:00:00.000Z","runtime":"102 min","genres":"Action, Thriller","director":"Rawson Marshall Thurber","writer":"Rawson Marshall Thurber","actors":"Dwayne Johnson, Neve Campbell, Chin Han, Roland Møller","plot":"A security expert must infiltrate a burning skyscraper, 225 stories above ground, when his family are trapped inside by criminals.","languages":"English, Cantonese, Mandarin","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGM3MzQwYzItNDA1Ny00MzIyLTg5Y2QtYTAwMzNmMDU2ZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMxOTE0ODA@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"47%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"51/100"}],"metascore":"51","rating":"6.0","votes":"26,881","imdbid":"tt5758778","type":"movie","dvd":"N/A","boxoffice":"N/A","production":"Universal Pictures","website":"https://www.skyscrapermovie.com/","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5758778"}},{"fileName":"side.effects.2013.1080p.bluray.x264-sparks.mkv","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/Side.Effects.2013.1080p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS [PublicHD]/side.effects.2013.1080p.bluray.x264-sparks.mkv","searchableName":"side effects 2013","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-08-25T14:36:53.000Z","modifiedTime":"2013-10-11T18:36:33.000Z","fileSizeMB":7831.1587018966675},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053463","imdbId":"tt2053463","imdbData":{"title":"Side Effects","_year_data":"2013","year":2013,"rated":"R","released":"2013-02-07T22:00:00.000Z","runtime":"106 min","genres":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","director":"Steven Soderbergh","writer":"Scott Z.

Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.","languages":"English","country":"Canada","awards":"24 wins & 42 nominations.","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDU2NjI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwMzYyOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"91/100"}],"metascore":"91","rating":"7.6","votes":"10,490","imdbid":"tt2366450","type":"movie","dvd":"03 Sep 2013","boxoffice":"$1,599,038","production":"Roadside Attractions","website":"http://storieswetellmovie.com/","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2366450"}},{"fileName":"The.Florida.Project.2017.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG].mp4","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/The Florida Project (2017) [1080p] [YTS.AG]/The.Florida.Project.2017.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG].mp4","searchableName":"The Florida Project 2017","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-03-09T22:35:15.000Z","modifiedTime":"2018-02-10T15:23:40.000Z","fileSizeMB":1721.6046838760376},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5649144","imdbId":"tt5649144","imdbData":{"title":"The Florida Project","_year_data":"2017","year":2017,"rated":"R","released":"2017-11-09T22:00:00.000Z","runtime":"111 min","genres":"Drama","director":"Sean Baker","writer":"Sean Baker, Chris Bergoch","actors":"Brooklynn Prince, Christopher Rivera, Aiden Malik, Josie Olivo","plot":"Set over one summer, the film follows precocious six-year-old Moonee as she courts mischief and adventure with her ragtag playmates and bonds with her rebellious but caring mother, all while living in the shadows of Walt Disney World.","languages":"English, Spanish, Portuguese","country":"USA","awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O'Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David's assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn't in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O'Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David's friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O'Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the \"sport\" and Jane O'Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O'Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","languages":"English","country":"New Zealand","awards":"16 nominations.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VmMTlhOTMtNDAwNi00NjIwLWJjMmUtNjg4OThkYWExYWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ2Mjc5MDM@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"93%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"76/100"}],"metascore":"76","rating":"7.6","votes":"11,922","imdbid":"tt5278506","type":"movie","dvd":"N/A","boxoffice":"$612,816","production":"Magnolia Pictures","website":"http://tickledmovie.com/","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5278506"}},{"fileName":"Trance.2013.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE.mkv","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/Trance.2013.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE [PublicHD]/Trance.2013.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE.mkv","searchableName":"Trance 2013","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-08-25T14:36:50.000Z","modifiedTime":"2014-01-24T21:18:59.000Z","fileSizeMB":4475.236657142639},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924429","imdbId":"tt1924429","imdbData":{"title":"Trance","_year_data":"2013","year":2013,"rated":"R","released":"2013-03-26T22:00:00.000Z","runtime":"101 min","genres":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","director":"Danny Boyle","writer":"Joe Ahearne (screenplay), John Hodge (screenplay), Joe Ahearne (story)","actors":"James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel, Rosario Dawson, Danny Sapani","plot":"A fine art auctioneer mixed up with a gang joins forces with a hypnotherapist to recover a lost painting.
